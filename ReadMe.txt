# Nodejs with TS

# Note - node doesn't execute Typescript. We can install 'ts-node' package which comes with TS compiler combined with the node executable.

# 'ts-node' could be nice choice for development but for production env, for really serving your files on some web server or web host 'ts-node' is not an ideal because having this extra compilation step, every time our code gets executed simply adds a bit of extra overhead which can be fine during development but which we probably don't want when our code is production ready.
